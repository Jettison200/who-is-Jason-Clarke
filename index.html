            <h1>WHO is JASON CLARKE ?</h1>
            <p class="data">I am a person who lives with High Standards. Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. I am able to say that I didn't let fear hold me back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had. </p>
            
            <p>I am not the person who blames others or makes excuses. One of the most important keys to success is having the discipline to do what you know you should do even when you don't feel like doing it--and those daily decisions often involve taking responsibility for your own choices and actions. I Remember that my actions do affect other people, so I am always careful with what I say and do. </p>
            
            <p>I am making a difference. I Don't tire when doing little things for others, because sometimes those little things occupy the biggest part of their hearts. In life we cannot always do great things, but, as Mother Teresa said, we can always do small things with great love. In the end it is not only about making a living, it is about making a difference.</p>
